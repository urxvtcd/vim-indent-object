INTRODUCTION                                      *indent-object-introduction*

This plugin provides text objects targeting indent levels, which is mainly
useful for working with whitespace-significant languages like Python. It also
allows targeting single delimiting lines above and below the indent level, which
is useful for languages with block end statements. It's a fork of
http://github.com/michaeljsmith/vim-indent-object. The original was forked
and rewritten to
  - hopefully make the code clearer,
  - add the blockwise objects that strip common indent from selection,
  - add mapping repeating last visual selection,
  - allow the closing delimiter to be selected independently,
  - handle mismatched delimiters better,
  - move from hardcoded mappings to `<Plug>` ones,
  - use on-demand loading via vim's autoload feature,
  - move from vmap and vnoremap to xmap and xnoremap,
  - and back all of this up with tests using Vader framework.

USAGE

The plugin defines no default concrete mappings, only abstract <Plug> ones.
You'll find them described below. Unless notet otherwise, mappings can be
invoked from either of visual or operator-pending mode.

Visual mode allows for iteration and interaction, as the mappings can be called
multiple times to iteratively increase the selected range. The initial indent
level is the indent level of the outermost line in the selected range.

Operator-pending mode allows for the text objects to be targets of verbs like
`d`, `c`, and so on. The initial indent level is the indent level of the
current line.

All of the mappings accept counts.

The plugin seems to be working fine in scenarios with tabs mixed with spaces,
however this is not actively tested for. Feel free to report weird behaviors.

                                                      *indent-object-linewise*
                                                     *indent-object-blockwise*

Mappings come in pairs of linewise and blockwise. The linewise selection just
selects whole ranges of lines. The blockwise selection on the other hand strips
the common indent, that is, the amount of indent equal to the indent level of
the line found to be outermost in the selection. It is useful for yanking code,
to be run in REPL for example. If you have used one of the mappings to visually
select some range, you can toggle between linewise and blockwise selection
types by issuing corresponding mapping of another type.

A known issue, that's planned to be fixed in future: Because the blank lines
are included in the selection, and blockwise mappings will include them as
well, there will be no common indent to be stripped, and you'll have to
manipulate the selection yourself.

                                                *indent-object-basic-mappings*
                                         *<Plug>(indent-object_linewise-none)*
                                        *<Plug>(indent-object_blockwise-none)*

The most basic kind of mapping selects all lines with the same or greater
indent level. All leading blank lines and all but the last trailing line are
selected as well.

Example:
>
    xmap ii <Plug>(indent-object_linewise-none)
    omap ii <Plug>(indent-object_blockwise-none)
<

                                        *<Plug>(indent-object_linewise-start)*
                                          *<Plug>(indent-object_linewise-end)*
                                         *<Plug>(indent-object_linewise-both)*
                                       *<Plug>(indent-object_blockwise-start)*
                                         *<Plug>(indent-object_blockwise-end)*
                                        *<Plug>(indent-object_blockwise-both)*

The delimiter mappins are mappings that beside the usual selection also include
delimiters for given indent. The starting and ending delimiters for a selection
with given indent level are defined as one line above and below having indent
level smaller than the selection. You can targer either one, or both of them.

If the delimiters have different indent, only the one with smaller indent is
taken into account, and the other one is assumed missing.

If you used one of the mappings to visually select some range without
a delimiter, you can include one or both delimiters without expanding outward
by invoking a mapping flipping the delimiter flags from false to true. If both
are flipped like this, both range ends will move, if only one of them is
flipped and the other is kept the same, one end will move. If a delimiter flag
is flipped from true to false, this is treated as a request to expand the
selection to another, smaller, indent level.


Example:
>
    xmap ai <Plug>(indent-object_linewise-start)
    omap ai <Plug>(indent-object_linewise-start)
    xmap iI <Plug>(indent-object_linewise-end)
    omap iI <Plug>(indent-object_linewise-end)
    xmap aI <Plug>(indent-object_linewise-both)
    omap aI <Plug>(indent-object_linewise-both)

                              *<Plug>(indent-object_linewise-none-keep-start)*
                               *<Plug>(indent-object_linewise-end-keep-start)*
                                *<Plug>(indent-object_linewise-none-keep-end)*
                               *<Plug>(indent-object_linewise-start-keep-end)*
                             *<Plug>(indent-object_blockwise-none-keep-start)*
                              *<Plug>(indent-object_blockwise-end-keep-start)*
                               *<Plug>(indent-object_blockwise-none-keep-end)*
                              *<Plug>(indent-object_blockwise-start-keep-end)*

The "keep end" mappings are mappings that expand selection only in one way,
upward or downward. There are four linewise text objects for "keep end"
mappings: two basic ones, and two delimiter ones:
  - keep start the same, and go down
  - keep start the same, and go down, including an ending delimiter
  - keep end the same, and go up
  - keep end the same, and go up, inluding a starting delimiter

Example of basic mappings:
>
    omap ij <Plug>(indent-object_linewise-none-keep-start)
    xmap ij <Plug>(indent-object_linewise-none-keep-start)
    omap ik <Plug>(indent-object_linewise-none-keep-end)
    xmap ik <Plug>(indent-object_linewise-none-keep-end)
<

Example of delimiter mappings:
>
    omap iJ <Plug>(indent-object_linewise-end-keep-start)
    xmap iJ <Plug>(indent-object_linewise-end-keep-start)
    omap iK <Plug>(indent-object_linewise-start-keep-end)
    xmap iK <Plug>(indent-object_linewise-start-keep-end)
<

The linewise mappings have their blockwise companions. Example:
>
    omap ibj <Plug>(indent-object_blockwise-none-keep-start)
    xmap ibj <Plug>(indent-object_blockwise-none-keep-start)
    omap ibJ <Plug>(indent-object_blockwise-end-keep-start)
    xmap ibJ <Plug>(indent-object_blockwise-end-keep-start)

    omap ibk <Plug>(indent-object_blockwise-none-keep-end)
    xmap ibk <Plug>(indent-object_blockwise-none-keep-end)
    omap ibK <Plug>(indent-object_blockwise-start-keep-end)
    xmap ibK <Plug>(indent-object_blockwise-start-keep-end)
>

                                                *<Plug>(indent-object_repeat)*

This mapping expands the selection range by repeating last invoked
indent-object action. It makes sense only in visual mode.

Example:
>
    xmap <C-o> <Plug>(indent-object_repeat)
<
